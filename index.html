        <p>It lies southwest of Sri Lanka and India, about 700 kilometres (430 mi) from the Asian continent's mainland.
            The chain of 26 atolls stretches from Ihavandhippolhu Atoll in the north to Addu Atoll in the south (across
            the Equator). Comprising a territory spanning roughly 298 square kilometres (115 sq mi), Maldives is one of
            the world's most geographically dispersed sovereign states as well as the smallest Asian country by land
            area and, with around 557,426 inhabitants, the 2nd least populous country in Asia. Malé is the capital and
            the most populated city, traditionally called the "King's Island" where the ancient royal dynasties ruled
            for its central location.The Maldivian Archipelago is located on the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge, a vast
            submarine mountain range in the Indian Ocean; this also forms a terrestrial ecoregion, together with the
            Chagos Archipelago and Lakshadweep.[14] With an average ground-level elevation of 1.5 metres (4 ft 11 in)
            above sea level,[15] and a highest natural point of only 5.1 metres (17 ft), it is the world's lowest-lying
            country.Maldives was a member of the Commonwealth from July 1982 until withdrawing from the organisation in
            October 2016 in protest at allegations by the other nations of its human rights abuses and failing
            democracy. The Maldives rejoined the Commonwealth on 1 February 2020 after showing evidence of functioning
            democratic processes and popular support.The Maldivian Archipelago is located on the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge,

            sultanate, developing strong commercial and cultural ties with Asia and Africa.</p>

        <p> In 1558 the Portuguese established a small garrison with a Viador (Viyazoru), or overseer of a factory
            (trading post) in the Maldives, which they administered from their main colony in Goa. Their attempts to
            impose Christianity provoked a local revolt led by Muhammad Thakurufaanu al-A'uẓam and his two brothers,
            that fifteen years later drove the Portuguese out of Maldives. This event is now commemorated as National
            Day.

            In the mid-17th century, the Dutch, who had replaced the Portuguese as the dominant power in Ceylon,
            established hegemony over Maldivian affairs without involving themselves directly in local matters, which
            were governed according to centuries-old Islamic customs.

            The British expelled the Dutch from Ceylon in 1796 and included Maldives as a British Protectorate. The
            status of Maldives as a British protectorate was officially recorded in an 1887 agreement in which the
            sultan accepted British influence over Maldivian external relations and defence while retaining home rule,
            which continued to be regulated by Muslim traditional institutions in exchange for an annual tribute. The
            status of the islands was akin to other British protectorates in the Indian Ocean region, including Zanzibar
            and the Trucial States.From the mid-16th-century the region came under the increasing influence of European
            colonial powers, with Maldives becoming a British protectorate in 1887. Independence from the United Kingdom
            came in 1965, and a presidential republic was established in 1968 with an elected People's Majlis. The
            ensuing decades have seen political instability, efforts at democratic reform,[16] and environmental
            challenges posed by climate change.</p>

            <p>On 26 December 2004, following the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the Maldives were devastated by a
                tsunami. Only nine islands were reported to have escaped any flooding,[61][62] while fifty-seven islands
                faced serious damage to critical infrastructure, fourteen islands had to be totally evacuated, and six
                islands were destroyed. A further twenty-one resort islands were forced to close because of tsunami
                damage. The total damage was estimated at more than US$400 million, or some 62% of the GDP.[63][64] 102
                Maldivians and 6 foreigners reportedly died in the tsunami.[60].</p>

            <p>Maldives became a founding member of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). It is
                also a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, the Organisation of Islamic
                Cooperation, and the Non-Aligned Movement. The World Bank classifies the Maldives as having an
                upper-middle income economy.[18] Fishing has historically been the dominant economic activity, and
                remains the largest sector by far, followed by the rapidly growing tourism industry. Maldives rate
                "high" on the Human Development Index,[12] with per-capita income significantly higher than other SAARC
                nations</p>
